                    <p>This website has been repurposed to update my friends and family on my progress toward learning to code and other techie things.  The overall design of this homepage was originally the design for the first site I've ever coded, which you can see here&excl; <a href ="jubilee/index.html">First Coding Adventure.</a> I've customized the orginal code from that project and made it my own.  The course I'm taking held my hand, step by step, on the process and best practices of building a simple page in HTML and CSS.</p>

                        <p>This page is currently one of the simpler types. If you're looking at this page on your phone, it will look a bit off.  This is an example of a nonresponsive webpage, which means it's only formatted for a computer screen.  Bust out your laptop if you want to see what it <em>really</em> looks like.</p>
                        <p>For my second project, my hand was let go&excl;  I was given a document in Photoshop called a PSD, which is basically a picture of what the website is supposed to look like.  You can see my new page by clicking <a href="rogue/index.html">here,</a> or the <a href="#nav">Work</a> button in the navigation bar.</p>

                        <h3>Bon Voyage</h3>
                        <p>Realizing that the pandemic is an incalcuable threat to the at&dash;risk darling of our home, I've accepted that &quot;essential&quot; work is not an option for me.  In order to work remotely, I've chosen to explore the depths of technology as a future source of income and hopefully a virtual means to fuel progress needed in our lives. </p>

                        <p>Realizing that there are countless paths in technology work, I found the Break Into Tech Course at <a href= "https://skillcrush.com">Skillcrush.com.</a>  This self-paced coursed allows me to work as hard as I can, and explore different aspects of the industry before forging down more specific paths.  So far, I'm ecstatic with this &quot;STEMinist&quot; &lpar;Google it&rpar; company's curriculum and support.</p>

                        <h3>Mission Control</h3>
                        <p>This site is my current project:  customizing my new website and learning to add new web pages.  Next, I will be learning how to build responsive websites, which will look much nicer on your phones.  I'm currently fast&dash;tracking the web development side of the course to make some sites for my friends... at rock bottom prices!  Gotta build that portfolio, naw mean&quest; &#128521;</p>
